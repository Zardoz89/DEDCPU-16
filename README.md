# DEDCPU-16 D Emulator for DCPU-16 #
A D based minimal emulator for Notch's DCPU-16 v1.1, written for the fun of it.
DEDCPU-16 aims to be a accurate and quick emulator working of CLI and capable of working like a emulation/debugger back-end for any IDE aimed to programming DCPU-16.

See: [DCPU-16 specs](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt)

Why: Why not ?

The test.ascii file was made with swetland dcpu-16 assembler
<https://github.com/swetland/dcpu16>

The notch.bin file was made with interfect dcpu-emu assembler
<https://bitbucket.org/interfect/dcpu-emu>

## Usage: ##
    ./dedcpu -ifilename [-ttype]
##Parameters:##
* __-i --i --input__ *file* : Input file with memory map
* __-t --t --type__ *lraw|braw|ahex* : Type of file with memory map. *lraw* -> little endian raw binary ; *braw* -> big endian raw binary ; *ahex* -> ascii hexadecimal file

## Commands: ##
* __q__               -> End emulation
* __s__ or Enter key  -> Step one instruction
* __r__ *number*      -> Runs number instructions without stop. 0 for running forever (Ctrl+C to abort)
* __m__ *begin[-end]* -> Display a chunk of RAM from begin to end address of RAM (address in hex). If end it's omitted, only show RAM value at begin address.
* __d__ *begin[-end]* -> Dumps a chunk of RAM to a __dump.bin__ file in little endian raw binary. Same semantics that __'m'__
* __i__ *text*        -> Sends text to keyboard input buffer in emulated machine
* __v__               -> Show a label showing the meaning of each column

In branch instructions, the emulator will read the next instruction but will no execute if the condition fails.

__NOTE__: video_test.bin writes in video ram (0x8000) forever. It test video ram and cooperative multitasking. This program is know that not runs in some emulators.
