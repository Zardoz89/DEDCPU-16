# DEDCPU Toolkit #

v 0.3.2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zardoz89/DEDCPU-16.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zardoz89/DEDCPU-16)

This tool-kit consists in a series of small tools related to the development around Notch's DCPU-16 computer.
The tool-kit it's actually increasing it's functionality and usefulness adding some interesting tools, like a converter between binary formats, a disassembler or LEM1802 font viewer.

## How install & build

Actually you have a few ways :

* You could grab a precompiled binary from "Releases" tab on Github.
* You could grab it with DLang package manager [dub](http://code.dlang.org/). This would imply to install a [D compiler](http://dlang.org/download.html) & [dub](http://code.dlang.org/) on your machine and run :

  ```
  dub fetch dedcpu
  dub build dedcpu:ddis
  dub build dedcpu:bconv
  dub build dedcpu:lem1802
  ```
  Binaries would be on inside of your .dub dir, or you can run the binaries with ```dub run dedcpu:XXX -- parameters```
* You could download/clone this repository and build it with :

  ```
  dub build dedcpu:ddis
  dub build dedcpu:bconv
  dub build dedcpu:lem1802
  ```
  Executables would be on the root dir of the repository.

### LEM1802 font viewer on Windows ###
Actually building this tool on windows it's more problematic. You should do this :

- Have installed [Gtk+ binary distribution >= 3.8](http://gtkd.org/download.html)
- Install GtkD 3.2 following his [own instructions for Windows](https://github.com/gtkd-developers/GtkD/wiki/Installing-on-Windows)
- Execute dub build dedcpu:lem1802

Eventually using dub should be more straightforward, like on GNU/Linux, but actually we need to do this to compile.

### Unitests ###

Actualy are only a single unittest that could be run with ```dub run dedcpu:test-bconv --build=unittest```

## Font viewer for LEM1802 screen

It's a graphic tool to load and view fonts for LEM1802 screen. It allow edit and view each glyph and show each glyph in binary, hexadecimal and decimal representations plus a graphic representation of it.

### Usage: ###
  ./lem1802_fontview

## D DISassembler for DCPU-16 v1.7 ##

### Usage: ###
  ./ddis filename [options]
### Options: ###
* __-h__                   Show this message
* __-t__ or __--type__ *type*  Type of file with memory map. __lraw__ -> little endian raw binary ; __braw__ -> big endian raw binary ; __ahex__ -> ascii hexadecimal file ; __dat__ -> Read DATs from a dasm file. By default ddis asumes little endian raw binary input file
* __-c__                   Add comments to all lines of the style [address] xxxx ....   where xxxx its the hexadecimal representation of these instruction.
* __-l__                   Auto-label all jumps (SET PC, .... and JSR ....)
* __-b__*number*           Sets the absolute position were begin to disassembly the file. By default it's 0
* __-e__*number*           Sets the absolute position were end to disassembly the file. By default it's the end of the file.

## Binary file CONVersor for DCPU-16 (any version)

### Usage: ###
  ./bconv input_filename output_filename [options]
### Options: ###
* __-h__                   Show this message
* __-i__ or __--itype__ *type* Type of input file with memory map. __lraw__ -> little endian raw binary ; __braw__ -> big endian raw binary ; __ahex__ -> ascii hexadecimal file ; __hexd__ -> ascii hexadecimal dump file. By default bconv assumes little endian raw binary input file.
* __-o__ or __--otype__ *type* Type of output file with memory map. __lraw__ -> little endian raw binary ; __braw__ -> big endian raw binary ; __ahex__ -> ascii hexadecimal file ; __hexd__ -> ascii hexadecimal dump file. By default bconv assumes ascii hexadecimal dump output file.
* __-b__*number*           Sets the absolute position were begin to convert the file. By default it's 0
* __-e__*number*           Sets the absolute position were end to convert the file. By default it's the end of the file.


## Notes
Files tester.hex and tester2.hex are hexadecimal dump files for testing disassemblers and emulators. You have the original dcpu-16 assembly code in tester.dasm and tester2.dasm.
