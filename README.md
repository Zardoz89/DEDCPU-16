# DEDCPU Toolkit #

This tool-kit consists in a series of small tools related to the development around Notch's DCPU-16 computer.
The tool-kit it's actually increasing it's functionality and usefulness adding some interesting tools, like a converter between binary formats, a disassemblers or LEM1802 font viewer.

## Font viewer for LEM1802 screen ##

It's a graphic tool to load and view fonts for LEM1802 screen. It allow edit and view each glyph and show each glyph in binary, hexadecimal and decimal representations plus a graphic representation of it.

### Usage: ###
  ./lem1802_fontview

## D DISassembler for DCPU-16 v1.7 ##

### Usage: ###
  ./ddis filename [options]
### Options: ###
* __-h__                   Show this message
* __-t__ or __--type__ *type*  Type of file with memory map. __lraw__ -> little endian raw binary ; __braw__ -> big endian raw binary ; __ahex__ -> ascii hexadecimal file ; __dat__ -> Read DATs from a dasm file. By default ddis asumes little endian raw binary input file
* __-c__                   Add comments to all lines of the style [address] xxxx ....   where xxxx its the hexadecimal representation of these instruction.
* __-l__                   Auto-label all jumps (SET PC, .... and JSR ....)
* __-b__*number*           Sets the absolute position were begin to disassembly the file. By default it's 0
* __-e__*number*           Sets the absolute position were end to disassembly the file. By default it's the end of the file.

## Binary file CONVersor for DCPU-16 (any version) ##

### Usage: ###
  ./bconv input_filename output_filename [options]
### Options: ###
* __-h__                   Show this message
* __-i__ or __--itype__ *type* Type of input file with memory map. __lraw__ -> little endian raw binary ; __braw__ -> big endian raw binary ; __ahex__ -> ascii hexadecimal file ; __hexd__ -> ascii hexadecimal dump file. By default bconv assumes little endian raw binary input file.
* __-o__ or __--otype__ *type* Type of output file with memory map. __lraw__ -> little endian raw binary ; __braw__ -> big endian raw binary ; __ahex__ -> ascii hexadecimal file ; __hexd__ -> ascii hexadecimal dump file. By default bconv assumes ascii hexadecimal dump output file.
* __-b__*number*           Sets the absolute position were begin to convert the file. By default it's 0
* __-e__*number*           Sets the absolute position were end to convert the file. By default it's the end of the file.


## Notes: ##
Files tester.hex and tester2.hex are hexadecimal dump files for testing disassemblers and emulators. You have the original dcpu-16 assembly code in tester.dasm and tester2.dasm.
