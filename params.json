{"name":"Dedcpu-16","body":"# DEDCPU-16 D Emulator for DCPU-16 #\r\nA D based minimal emulator for Notch's DCPU-16 v1.1, written for the fun of it.\r\nDEDCPU-16 aims to be a accurate and quick emulator working of CLI and capable of working like a emulation/debugger back-end for any IDE aimed to programming DCPU-16.\r\n\r\nSee: [DCPU-16 specs](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt)\r\n\r\nWhy: Why not ?\r\n\r\nThe test.ascii file was made with swetland dcpu-16 assembler\r\n<https://github.com/swetland/dcpu16>\r\n\r\nThe notch.bin file was made with interfect dcpu-emu assembler\r\n<https://bitbucket.org/interfect/dcpu-emu>\r\n\r\n## Usage: ##\r\n    ./dedcpu -ifilename [-ttype]\r\n##Parameters:##\r\n* __-i --i --input__ *file* : Input file with memory map\r\n* __-t --t --type__ *lraw|braw|ahex* : Type of file with memory map. *lraw* -> little endian raw binary ; *braw* -> big endian raw binary ; *ahex* -> ascii hexadecimal file\r\n\r\n## Commands: ##\r\n* quit __q__               - End emulation\r\n* step __s__ or Enter key  - Step one instruction\r\n* run __r__ *number*       - Runs number instructions without stop. 0 for running forever (Ctrl+C to abort)\r\n* memory display __m__ *begin[-end]* - Display a chunk of RAM from begin to end address of RAM (address in hex). If end it's omitted, only show RAM value at begin address.\r\n* dump memory __d__ *begin[-end]* - Dumps a chunk of RAM to a __dump.bin__ file in little endian raw binary. Same semantics that __'m'__\r\n* view label __v__         - Show a label showing the meaning of each column\r\n\r\n#### Example of use: ####\r\nMemory Display command:\r\n![Program example writing Video RAM](http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/368/dedcpu3.png)\r\n\r\n## Notes: ##\r\n* video_test.bin writes in video ram (0x8000) forever. It test video ram and cooperative multitasking. This program is know that not runs in some emulators.\r\n* In branch instructions, the emulator will read the next instruction but will no execute if the condition fails.\r\n\r\nBased over DCPU-16 C Emulator of Karl Hobley turbodog10(at)yahoo.co.uk\r\n\r\n## License: ##\r\nThis project is licensed under the BSD license.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Luis Panadero Guarde√±o\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n1.
