DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: ZGPxxxx - Zempston+ Game Port board
    ID: 0xxxxxxxxx, version: 0xxxx
    Manufacturer: 0xxxxxxxxx
    Document version: 1.1
    
    
Change history:
    1.0: Initial release.
    1.1: Updated QUERY_INTERRUPT_TYPE to a bitmap
    
Description:
    The ZGPxxxx, Zempston+ Game Port board .... bla bla bla ...................
    ...........................................................................
    supports two joystick per board, and each joystick supports a outstanding
    quantity of four buttons and two analogical axis that allow precise and
    soft control for any kind of game.
    
    
Interrupt behaviour:
    The ZGPxxxx supports a number of HWI commands based on the value of the A
    register:
    
    0x0000: QUERY_JOYSTICK_PRESENT
            Sets B register value according the number of connected joysticks.
            It sets the be register to B if not are any joystick plugged in the
            board.
            
    0x0001: QUERY_J1_VALUES
            Reads the joystick 1 axis and buttons values, setting:
            
            LSB of B: Signed integer that represent X axis value. 0 means center
                      , 127 means full right and -127 means full left.
            MSB of B: Signed integer that represent Y axis value. 0 means center
                      , 127 means full up and -127 means full bottom.
            C = A bit map showing each button pressed. Where the lowest bit
                it's the button 1.

            If Joystick 1, it's unplugged, this values will be all 0.
            
    0x0002: QUERY_J2_VALUES
            Reads the joystick 2 axis and buttons values, setting:

            LSB of B: Signed integer that represent X axis value. 0 means center
                      , 127 means full right and -127 means full left.
            MSB of B: Signed integer that represent Y axis value. 0 means center
                      , 127 means full up and -127 means full bottom.
            C = A bit map showing each button pressed. Where the lowest bit
                it's the button 1.

            If Joystick 2, it's unplugged, this values will be all 0.
            
    0x0003: QUERY_INTERRUPT_TYPE
            The device will indicate the type of interrupt that it last raised 
            by clearing B and seeting one or more bits to 1
            
            bit 0 : If it's ON, there a Button 1 pressed on J1
            bit 1 : If it's ON, there a Button 2 pressed on J1
            bit 2 : If it's ON, there a Button 3 pressed on J1
            bit 3 : If it's ON, there a Button 4 pressed on J1

            bit 4 : If it's ON, there a Button 1 pressed on J2
            bit 5 : If it's ON, there a Button 2 pressed on J2
            bit 6 : If it's ON, there a Button 3 pressed on J2
            bit 7 : If it's ON, there a Button 4 pressed on J2
            
            Rest of bits are not used
            
    0x0004: ACTIVATE_INTERRUPTS
            Reads A, and if A it's 0, not send any interrupt. If A value it's 1
            or grater, then activate sending interrupts.
    
    0x0005: SET_INTERRUPT_MESSAGE
            Specifies the message the device should use for software interrupts.
            Takes one parameter:
            
            B = Interrupt number to use when interrupting the DCPU.
            
            If the device raises an interrupt before the message is set, it will
            default to using 0xFFFF.
            
Some spec stuff that you are free to change or remove that only give a bit more
of realism.
            
Characteristic of game port:
    Connector: DA-15 female
    Pin-out:
      Pin   |   Description
    -----------------------------------------
       1    |  +5V DC
       2    |  Button 1
       3    |  Button 2
       4    |  Button 3
       5    |  Button 4
       6    |  Not used (reserved)
       7    |  Not used (reserved)
       8    |  Not used (reserved)
       9    |  Not used (reserved)
      10    |  X axis (0-100 kOhm)
      11    |  GND for X axis
      12    |  Y axis (0-100 kOhm)
      13    |  GND for Y axis
      14    |  GND (short-circuit with pin 15 inside the joystick)
      15    |  GND

    Pin 14 must be short-circuited with pin 15, because allow to
    detect when a joysticks is plugged.

    Max total current: 750 mA

Electrical connection:
    Each axis it's connect in the board to a ADC that reads the resistive value
    of each axis. At his maximal resistive value, it represents up/right and
    his minimal value, represents bottom/left. This allow using lineal pots for
    analogical joysticks or switches that commute resistors for digital
    joysticks/pads.

    Each button, works setting +5V DC, using a simple switch and a resistor of
    100kOhm connected to ground and the pin. Internally the board
    had capacitators of 0,1uC to remove bounce effect of switches.
