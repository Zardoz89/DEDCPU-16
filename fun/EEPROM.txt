DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: ROMxxxx - ROM chip
    ID: 0xxxxxxxxx, version: 0xxxx

Description:
    Generic Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM device specs
    
    
Interrupt behaviour:
        
    0x0000: CLONE_ROM_TO_RAM
            Clone the contain of the EEPROM chip to the RAM of the DCPU-16. It
            uses the value of A register to get the origine where to map in the
            RAM. So if A = 0x0000, the EEPROM chip will clone all his contain to
            the RAM from the RAM addres 0x0000 to 0x(size)
            
    0x0001: GET_SIZE
            Sets B register to the EEPROM chip size in 16bit words.
            
    0x0002: SERIAL_NUMBER
            Sets B register to the EEPROM chip Serial Number
            
    0x0003: CLONE_RAM_TO_ROM
            Clone the contain of a slice of RAM of DCPU-16 to the EEPROM chip.
            It uses the value of A register to get the origin address of RAM
            were to read, and C register value to get the size of the slice in
            16bit words. For example, using A = 0 , B = 0x200, It will write to
            the EEPROM the first 512 word of the RAM.
            This process takes 5 cycles per 512 words writed in EEPROM
            chip.
