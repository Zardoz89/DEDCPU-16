A D based minimal emulator for Notch's DCPU-16 v1.1, written for the fun of it.
DEDCPU-16 aims to be a accurate and quick emulator working of CLI and capable of working like a emulation/debugger back-end for any IDE aimed to programming DCPU-16.

Usage:
  ./dedcpu -ifilename [-ttype]
Parameters:
  -i --i --input : Input file with memory map
  -t --t --type lraw|braw|ahex : Type of file with memory map. lraw -> little endian raw binary ; braw -> big endian raw binary ; ahex -> ascii hexadecimal file

Commands:
  quit            q                End emulation
  step            s or Enter key   Step one instruction
  run             r number         Runs number instructions without stop. Nothing or 0 for running forever (Ctrl+C to abort)
  breakpoint      b address        Toggle breakpoint at address. Only works if is the begin of a valid instruction.
  memory display  m begin[-end]    Display a chunk of RAM from begin to end address of RAM (address in hex). If end it's omitted, only show RAM value at begin address.
  memory dump     d begin[-end]    Dumps a chunk of RAM to a dump.bin file in little endian raw binary. Same semantics that 'm'
  input           i text           Sends text to keyboard input buffer in emulated machine
  view header     v                Show a label showing the meaning of each column

In branch instructions, the emulator will read the next instruction but will no execute if the condition fails.
