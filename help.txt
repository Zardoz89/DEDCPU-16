DEDCPU-16 aims to be a acurrated and wuick emulator working of CLI and capable of working like a emulation/debugger backend for any IDE aimed to programing DCPU-16.

Usage:
  ./dedcpu -ifilename [-ttype]
Parameters:
  -i --i --input : Input file with memmory map
  -t --t --type lraw|braw|ahex : Type of file with memory map. lraw -> little endian raw binary ; braw -> big endian raw binary ; ahex -> ascii hexadecimal file

Commands:
  q or Q              -> End emulation
  s or S or Enter key -> Step one instruction
  r or R number       -> Runs number instructions without stop. 0 for running forever (Ctrl+C to abort)
