A D based minimal emulator for Notch's DCPU-16 v1.1, written for the fun of it.

See: http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

Why: Why not ?

The text hex file was made with swetland dcpu-16 assembler
https://github.com/swetland/dcpu16

Usage:
./dedcpu -ifilename [-b]
Parameters:
  -i --i --input : Input file with the machine code
  -b : Use binary little-endian format of interfect dcpu-emu. By default the emulator read textual files in big-endian made by swetland dcpu-16 assembler

Commands:
  q or Q              -> End emulation
  s or S or Enter key -> Step one instruction
  r or R number       -> Runs number instructions without stop

In branch instructions, the emulator will read the next instruction but will no execute if the condition fails.
