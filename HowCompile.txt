DEDCPU toolkit uses D2 language, plus the GUI tools like LEM1802 font viewer
  uses gtkd to bind to gtk+ 2 graphic tool-kit.
  
Linux:
  If you are using a Debian derivative distribution, like Ubuntu or Mint, you can
  use APT with the D repository that contains gtkd library plus D official
  compiler. Repository for D at: https://code.google.com/p/d-apt/wiki/APT_Repository
  If you have Ubuntu 12.xx You can install directly gdc (for language version 2).
  If have a more older version of Ubuntu, DON'T USE GDC FROM UBUNTU REPOSITORY.
  
  You only need to simple run:
    make
  It will generate executable file in the same directory
  If you not need the Graphic tools, you can compile console utils with
    make cli
  also you can compile only the graphic tools with
    make gui
  
Windows:
  For building in windows, DEDCPU toolkit uses rdmd build tool that comes with 
  D2 oficial compiler. You can download it from:
  http://dlang.org/download.html
  GtkD files are inclued like a git submodule, so you only need to install the 
  last runtime of gtk+2 and nothing more.
  There two batch files to build CLI tools and GUI tools. 
    build_cli.bat
    build.gui.bat
  
Mac:
  I recommend to use the official D compiler from http://dlang.org/download.html
  And you can download gtkd from http://www.dsource.org/projects/gtkd
  
  You only need to simple run:
    make
  It will generate executable file in the same directory
  If you not need the Graphic tools, you can compile console utils with
    make cli
  also you can compile only the graphic tools with
    make gui
