DEDCPU toolkit uses D2 language, plus the GUI tools like LEM1802 font viewer
  uses gtkd to bind to gtk+ 2 graphic toolkit.
  If you are using a Debian derivated distribution, like Ubuntu of Mint, you can
  use APT with the D repository that contains gtkd library plus D official
  compiler. Repository for D at: https://code.google.com/p/d-apt/wiki/APT_Repository

  If you have Ubuntu 12.xx You can install directly gdc (for language version 2).
  If have a more older version of Ubuntu, DON'T USE GDC FROM UBUNTU REPOSITORY.
  For Windows and Mac I recomend to use the official D compiler from
  http://dlang.org/download.html
  And you can download gtkd from http://www.dsource.org/projects/gtkd
  
  
To compile:
  You only need to simple run:
    make
  It will generate executable file in the same directory
  If you not need the Ggrpahic tools, you can compile console utils with
    make cli
  also you can compile only the graphic tools with
    make gui
