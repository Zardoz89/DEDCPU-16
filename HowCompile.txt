DDis and DEDCPU are made with D2 language, so you need a D2 compiler:
  If you have Ubuntu 12.xx You can install gdc (for language version 2).
  If have a more older version of Ubuntu, DON'T USE GDC FROM UBUNTU REPOSITORY.
  Instead I recomend to use the official D compiler at
  http://dlang.org/download.html for older versions of Ubuntu or for Windows and
  Mac.
  Also, if you are using and Debian derivated distro, you can use the APT
  Repository for D at: https://code.google.com/p/d-apt/wiki/APT_Repository

To compile:
  You only need to simple run:
    make
  It will generate executable file in a /bin directory
