If you have Ubuntu 12.xx You can install gdc (for language version 2) and simply do:
gdmd dedcpu.d -J.

If have a more older version of Ubuntu, or you are using other distribution or other SO, use the 
official D compiler at http://dlang.org/download.html and run in console:
dmd dedcpu.d -J.

For companion disassembler, follow similar procedure :
gdmd or dmd ddis.d disassembler.d -J.
